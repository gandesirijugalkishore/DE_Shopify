# DE_Shopify

## This repo is for Shopify Data Engineering Position.

I have created an Image repository using Django with functinalities like:

1. `Image Upload`
2. `Image Delete`
3.` Image Filter`
4. `Image View`
5. `Also has an about page which redirects to the author.`

For all the above operations i have used basic django fucntionalities url,view,model and templates.

I have created a url initially and liked it to a view along with respective templates.Then created a database using the .models file and registerd it in the app.py.

# How to Run the application:

To run this application, simply run  `python3 manage.py runserver`  from the command line. You can open your local host in the web browser and the the gallery page shoudl redirect.

You will see a listing of images with associated description.

You can filter,add,delete images using the options accordingly.
